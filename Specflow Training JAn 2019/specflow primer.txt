Recommended Learning Plan for starting to work with Specflow and Selenium. 

More advanced topics such as the following ones are covered here, most are necessary knowledge in the long run:
-Step Transformations,
-Multiple test environments using App and Build configuration,
-Shared specflow test libraries and cross project invocation,
-Nuget building for test drivers and common components,
-Service test drivers (WCF, REST, JWT/OUATH, NSERVICE BUS...) 
-Selenium Grid, 
-Parallel test execution, 
-Mobile Testing


a) Read up about BDD, Gherkin and Specflow

b) Read up about Selenium Webdriver 2

c) create a basic VS solution equipped with Specflow and Selenium GUI test running capability
for this see instructions in folder "Very Basic Setup of Specflow and Selenium  Jan 2019"
(best is to build the solution yourself and not just use the one given)

d) now take the solution created in c) and practice the most common Specflow constructs
- create a scenario with all three types of steps: Given, When and Then
- assert expected conditions in Then steps 
- use Scenario Context to pass data between steps
- employ data tables in test steps
- scenario outlines
- background steps

e) with specflow basics mastered, create a few high quality, fully implemented test scenarios that include
- true path test cases
- negative test cases
- parameter validation test cases
- multiple assertions
- including asserting maximum arrival time for expected events

f) study a more complex automation framework with examples
